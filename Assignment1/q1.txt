Step 1: Identify the States
We need to track the number of 'a’s and ensure that it’s even, and then accept one or more 'b’s. So, we can have the following states:

q0: Initial state, where we haven’t seen any input yet.
q1: We’ve seen an odd number of 'a’s.
q2: We’ve seen an even number of 'a’s.
q3: Final state, where we’ve seen at least one ‘b’ after an even number of 'a’s.

Step 2: Define the Transition Function
The transition function δ is defined as follows:

δ(q0, a) = q1
δ(q1, a) = q2
δ(q2, a) = q1
δ(q2, b) = q3
δ(q3, b) = q3

Step 3: Define the Initial and Final States
The initial state is q0, and the final state is q3.

Now, let’s write a Python program to simulate this DFSM:
