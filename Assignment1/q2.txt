Identify the States: Since we are counting the occurrences of ‘a’ and ‘b’ modulo 3, we will have 9 states in total (0, 1, 2 for ‘a’ and 0, 1, 2 for ‘b’).
Identify the Start State: The start state will be (0, 0) as initially we have seen 0 'a’s and 0 'b’s.
Identify the Accept States: The accept states will be those where Na (w) mod 3 = Nb (w) mod 3. So, the accept states will be (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2).
Identify the Transitions: For each state, we will have two transitions - one for ‘a’ and one for ‘b’. If we are in state (i, j) and we see an ‘a’, we will move to state ((i+1) mod 3, j). If we see a ‘b’, we will move to state (i, (j+1) mod 3).
Now, let’s write a Python program to simulate this DFSM.
